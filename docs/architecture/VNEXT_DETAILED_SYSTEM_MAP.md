# vNext Detailed System Map

The target architecture is intentionally fine-grained. A node exists only where there is a distinct responsibility, lifecycle, durable authority, effect authority, identity domain or replaceable provider boundary.

## Recursive rules

- Parent owns composition of children, never child implementation state.
- Each node has exactly one primary authority declaration.
- Observation nodes cannot mutate durable domain authority.
- Provider selection happens only in composition.
- API packages contain contracts/identities/ports, not workers, locks, persistence mutation or provider branching.
- This tree is established before implementation migration; old modules are not used to define the new boundaries.

## Artifact System

## Reliability System

Section 42 scaffold contraction treats causal/timeline diagnostics, failure catalog/descriptor/envelope/fingerprint/materialization/taxonomy, incident/policy, reconciliation facets, and recovery evidence/plan/replay as facets of retained Reliability authorities rather than independently registered systems.

## Scientific semantics convergence

`Scientific` is no longer an independent platform system. ROLE03 Trial/Study convergence folds reusable research-design, measurement, analysis and trial-protocol semantics into `experimentation/study`; concrete method/agent/provider behavior remains behind Participant and downstream project contracts. The historical `noetrium_platform.research.scientific/**` shell is deleted rather than retained as a compatibility authority.
